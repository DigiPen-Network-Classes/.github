# Repositories of Interest to Students

## PUTTER the amazing JSON based Unit Test Program!

Ok maybe it's not so amazing, Putter reads unit tests from very Postman-like JSON files and executes them against your web server. Used in assignments for verifying your code works and for grading.
Originally, these files were edited and run from Postman, but that lives behind a paywall now. So Putter implements the 1% functionality we actually needed.

## try.redis.io A Redis Sandbox and Tutorial

Long ago, there was a website that had a pretty good tutorial for redis, complete with sandbox so you could type in commands. The code has fallen to disuse and the hosted website is long gone. This fork of the originals provides a Dockerfile and a way to run a containerized version of that code. Good enough for classroom use, not secure for hosting on a public website!

# Other Fun Things

## SCARY CAVE an HTTP aware Text MUD

Part of a lecture example that grew and then ran amok, this is the source code to (The Scary Cave)[https://scarycaves.meancat.com] and occasionally it gets features added to it. Not meant to be serious, and designed to use as few resources as possible (i.e. free to host).
